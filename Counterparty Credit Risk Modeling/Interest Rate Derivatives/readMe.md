# Interest Rate Derivatives
This section demonstrates how C++ can be utilized in pricing interest rate derivatives. 
It will explore two instances: the valuation of a plain vanilla *Interest Rate Swap (IRS)* (basic demonstration) and the evaluation of a more complex Cap (advanced demonstration). 
Both examples employ a one-factor *Libor Market Model (LMM)* and Monte Carlo simulation for solving.
