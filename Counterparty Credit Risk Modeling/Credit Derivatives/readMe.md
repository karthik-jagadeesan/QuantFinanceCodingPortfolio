# Credit Derivatives
Here, our attention shifts towards employing C++ for evaluating credit derivatives. 
We examine two instances: firstly, employing the Merton model to price a 
defaultable firm's equity with the inclusion of the firm's default probability (basic demonstration). 
The other example will be the valuation of *Credit Default Swap (CDS)* contracts (advanced demonstration). 
The former relies on the structural methodology for assessing credit risk, whereas the latter employs the intensity approach.
